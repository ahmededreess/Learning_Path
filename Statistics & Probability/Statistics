### Statistics & Probability 
- Types of data: 
   1. quantitive : ( discret, Continous) 
   2. qualitive : ( nomial , ordered ) 
 
- the types of distribution 
   1. Frequency table 
   2. relative frequency table 
   3. Dot plot 
   4. Histogram 
   5. stem and leaf plot 
   6. box plot 
   7- Scatterplot 
   8- line diagram 
   
- the shapes of Distributions : 
  1. normal distributions 
  2. right skewed distributions 
  3. left skewed distributions 
  
- the attributies of the distributions 
  1.cluster                                2. gaps 
  3.outlier                                4. peak 
  
 - the center and spread of measures 
   1. mean                                 2. median
   3. mode                                 4. IQR 
   5. Varience                             6. standard Deviation 
   
   - impacting of the outlier 
   - impacting of removing postive outlier or negative outlier
   - impacting of increasing or decreasing the value of outlier
   - impacting of changing the dataset on the center and spread measures like ( adding, shifting , scaling values from the dataset) 
       and how to affect on the measures like mean, median , standard deviation. 
       
       
   - percentile is the percent of the all data below the value we want.
   - z-score measures exactly how many standard deviations above or below the mean a data point is
   - Density curve is when the area under the curve is equal 1 ( like the 5 sugar soup is 100% of the drink or less) 
   - empirical rule used for know the percent of the normal distribution ( 68% - 95% - 99.7% )
   
   - Scatterplots has some properties : 
       1. Form: Is the association linear or nonlinear?
       2. Direction: Is the association positive or negative?
       3. Strength: Does the association appear to be strong, moderately strong, or weak?
       4. Outliers: Do there appear to be any data points that are unusually far away from the general pattern?

       
    - The correlation coefficient r  measures the direction and strength of a linear relationship
    
    - When we see a relationship in a scatterplot, we can use a line to summarize the relationship in the data.
      We can also use that line to make predictions in the data. This process is called linear regression
    
    - the statistical question is any question needed to collect data.
    - the types of bias
       1. uncovering sample. 
       2. overestimating sample like singers make a vote on his website about his sings.
       3. volunteering sample is to ask his relatives to vote for him. 
     
     
     ### Probability 
     
     - Probability is simply how likely something is to happen.
     - Probability of an event = (# of ways it can happen) / (total number of outcomes)
     
     - There are some definitions we studied like ( union , intersection , Relative complement , Universal set )
     
     
   - The types of probability:
       1. Experimental Probability: when we get the probability of events depends on the last experience or last experiments
           (like the probability of winning of football team is 30%  that because the last 10 matches, it won only 3 matches) 
       2. Theoretical Probability: it depends on the logical calculation like flipping coin. 
      
  - The addition Rule for probability and using it with Vann Diagram : 
     1. P(prefers dogs or is female)=P(prefers dogs)+P(is female)−P(prefers dogs and is female)
    
   - Dependent events : when first event happening impacts the probability of the second event.
   - Independent events : when first event happening does not impact the probability of the second. 
   
   - The multiplication Rule for Independent events or dependent events:
       P(A and B)=P(A)⋅P(B∣A) 
       
    - When the events are independent P(B|A) equals P(B) so the rule will be:
           P(A and B) = P(A).P(B) 
           
    - Permutation: 
          •	P(n,r) = nPr = n!/(n-r)! 
    - Combinations:
           •	C(n,r)= n! / r!(n-k)!
     
    - Probability using combination: 
    
    - General Rule for binomial coefficients (Probability with Combination) :
        - P( K outcome of N flips ) = (1/2^ n * nC k )
