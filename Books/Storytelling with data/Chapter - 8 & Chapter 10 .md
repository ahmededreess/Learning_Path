#### Chapter 8. pulling it all together
    - the steps you should follow to be able to draw a good graph :
    
        1. understand the context and try to know exactly who your audience are and what they need to know and how to show that. 
        2. then you will start to choose the suitable graph to show your idea 
        3. then eliminate the clutter (anything can be removed without affecting on the graph ) 
        4. Draw attention where you want it , with color , size , text , 
        5. then try to think like the designer 
        6. try to tell us the story
        
        
        
#### Chapter 10. final thoughts
    1. practice, practice, and practice some more. Look for opportunities in your work to apply the lessons we’ve learned
    2. learn your tools well: learn your tool well and practice and search on the internet to reach the best solution 
    3. start with a blank piece of paper. This enables you to brainstorm without the constraints of your tools or
        what you know how to do in your tools. Sketch out potential views to see them side‐by‐side
        and determine what will work best for getting your message across to your audience
    4. Create a version of the graph (let’s call it A), then make a copy of it (B) and make a single change. Then determine which looks better—A or B.
    5. At any point, if the best path is unclear, seek feedback. The fresh set of eyes that a friend or
       colleague can bring to the data visualization endeavor is invaluable
    6. Imitation really is the best form of flattery . make a copy of visualization you admire and reflect why it is effective,
        There are a number of great blogs and resources on the topic of data visualization :
        1. Eager Eyes (eagereyes.org, Robert Kosara)
        2. FiveThirtyEight’s Data Lab (fivethirtyeight.com/datalab, various authors): I like their typically minimalist graphing style on a large range of news and current events topics.
        3. Flowing Data (flowingdata.com, Nathan Yau): Membership gets you premium content, but there are a lot of great free examples of data visualization as well
