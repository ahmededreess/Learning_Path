#### Focus your audience attention where you want it.

   ##### Preattentive attributes :
        - enable our audience to see what we want them to see before they even know they’re seeing it!
        - preattentive attributes can be extremely useful for doing two things:
            - (1) drawing your audience’s attention quickly to where you want them to look
            - (2) creating a visual hierarchy of information
        - Preattentive attributes types
            - Preattentive attributes in text : that will occur by changing ( Color , Bold , Size , Outline (enclosure), underline or display it hierarchy
            - Preattentive attributes in graphs: size, color, and position on page
                
        - one of the most important in displaying the dashboard is the following :
            - Size of the graph
            - Color
            - Position on the page : the correct position is from left is : 1    2    
                                                                            3    4
        
        - Design with colorblind in mind 
        there are a number of sites and applications with colorblindness simulators that allow you to see what your visual looks like through colorblind eyes.
         For example, Vischeck (vischeck.com) allows you to upload images or download the tool to use on your own computer.
         
 #### chapter 5 ( think like a designer ) 
 
  you are like a designer So you should have tools to help you in your work , So let’s start with the following :
    - **Highlight the important stuff** by using the ( Color - Size - UpperCase - Bold )
    - **Eliminate distractions** ( You know you’ve achieved perfection, not when you , have nothing more to add, but when you have nothing to take away )
        - Not all data are equally important
        - When detail isn’t needed, summarize
        - Ask yourself: would eliminating this change anything?
    - **Create a clear visual hierarchy of information ** is like categorize the data to parts.
    - **Accessibility** is to make your visualization easy to interpret and understand.
    - **Don’t overcomplicate:**
    - **Text is your friend**: if you have a graph and reach to conclusion, he should write this conclusion
    - Aesthetics
        - look for examples of effective data visualization to follow
        - When you see a graph that looks nice, pause to consider what you like about it
    - **Acceptance**
