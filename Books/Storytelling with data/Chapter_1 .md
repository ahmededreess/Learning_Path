### book Storytelling is very useful and help you to improve your data visualization , let's start summerizing the main points in the book as the following :



#### 1. Chapter 1 - Understand the context 
         - Exploratory vs. explanatory analysis , the difference between them that you try to explore pearls
         ( unusual thing in your data or connection between two variables , patterns repeat each time)
         زى بالظبط الى بيدور على اللؤلؤ فى المحار وانت بدور بتعمل شرح للداتا انما
         او ما تلاقى حاجة مهمه انك تعرضها ساعتها انت اكتشفت حاجه 
    
  ##### - to understand the context you should follow the next questions :

        1. who is your audience ( parents or teachers , sure there is difference ) ?
        2.  what do you want your audience know or do ? 
        3. How can you make your data make your point ? 
        4. What would a successful outcome look like?
        5. If you only had a limited amount of time or a single sentence to tell your audience
           what they need to know, what would you say?

 #####    - three ideas are very important before start your visualization to make your idea clear and be successful with your visualization :
 
        1. 3 minutes story : if you had only three minutes to tell your audience what they need to know, what would you say? 
            This is a great way to ensure you are clear on and can articulate the story you want to tell.
            
        2. Big Idea : it boils the so‐what down even further: to a single sentence.

        3. Stroy board : It is a visual outline of the content you plan to create. it helps 
           to ensure the communication you craft is on point. 
           it also establishes a structure for your communication. 
        
 #####    - Some notes you should take in your consideration.

        1. Don’t ignore the non supporting data with your goal , you may need it. 
        2. there is difference between the live presentation and report in email 
           (the control and level of details should take in your consideration ). 
        3. your tone with your presentation is important.
