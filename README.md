### SQL my journey , I hope to find it useful for your learning journey also. 

the most important thing I tried to learn is when to use the function , not how to work because you can find that easily in many sites.So let's start and if you find 
something not clear or not correct , thanks to get back to me and give me the feedback. 

1- Subquery 
  a. subquery with select 
    1. you can use it if you will perform complex calculation. 
    2- if you need a value to compare it with other values like average or the maximun value.
    
    
   b. subquery with from 
     1. to restructure and transform your data ( when you find the query complex, try to restructure the table first then use from (select...) to get your request.
     2- using to prefiltering ( if you need to filter the table first get the value you need. 
     
    c. subquery with where 
     1. to use it when you need a value like max or min or averge to filter by using it 
     2- now you need not only the value but you may need a column or filtered table to compare a column with it 
     
     
lets write some queries to make it clear for using it.
